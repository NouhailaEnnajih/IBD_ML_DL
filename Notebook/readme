# Microbiome ML/DL Analysis

This repository contains two files: a **Python script (`.py`)** and a **Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`)**. Both files perform the same analysis, so you can use either depending on your preference.

## Inputs
- **Taxa table:** Exported file from Script 3 containing processed and renamed taxa.

## Steps Performed

1. **Data Splitting**  
   - The dataset is split into training and test sets.

2. **Data Balancing**  
   - SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is applied to the training set to balance class distributions.

3. **Normalization**  
   - Features are normalized to ensure comparable scales across taxa abundances.

4. **Model Training**  
   - Multiple machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models are trained on the preprocessed data.

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Models are evaluated using cross-validation metrics such as ROC AUC and balanced accuracy.
   - Statistical tests are performed to compare model performance.

## Notes
- Both the Python script and the notebook perform identical steps; choose whichever format is more convenient.
- Cross-validation ensures robust performance estimates across different data splits.
